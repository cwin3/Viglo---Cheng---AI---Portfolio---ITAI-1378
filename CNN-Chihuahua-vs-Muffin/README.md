# CNN: Chihuahua vs Muffin Classifier

## Problem Statement
This project explores whether a convolutional neural network can accurately
distinguish between images of chihuahuas and muffins, a classic image
classification challenge.

## Approach
A CNN model was designed and trained using image data to learn visual
patterns and features. The notebook walks through data preparation,
model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Results
- Model successfully learned distinguishing features
- Performance evaluated using accuracy and training metrics
- Demonstrates the strengths and limitations of CNNs

## Key Findings
This project reinforced the importance of dataset quality, model tuning,
and visualization when working with image classification tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available image dataset.
The dataset is not included in this repository and must be loaded
externally as described in the notebook.

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or run locally using Python 3.8+.
